# Project Cleanup & Setup Plan

## Issues Found & Solutions

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: GitHub Actions Permission Error (FIXED)
**Problem**: GitHub Actions tried to deploy to GitHub Pages but lacked permissions.  
**Solution**: Removed GitHub Pages deployment from workflow. Vercel will handle deployment automatically.

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: Console Errors (189 errors)
**Problem**: Browser console shows errors because HTML files reference assets that don't exist in development.  
**Solution**: These are expected in development. They'll disappear once you:
1. Run `npm run build` (creates production assets)
2. Deploy to Vercel (serves built files correctly)

**Console errors are normal in development mode with Vite!**

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Unnecessary Files
**Files you can safely remove**:
- `src/devops.html` - Example skills page (if you don't need it)
- `src/frontend.html` - Example skills page (if you don't need it)
- `src/testing.html` - Example skills page (if you don't need it)
- `src/utils/helpers.test.js` - Example unit test
- `cleanup-optional.sh` - Temporary cleanup script
- `QUICK_START.md` - Temporary guide (after you're set up)
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Can keep or remove after deployment

## Step-by-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: GitHub Settings (Required)

#### A. Enable Actions Permissions
1. Go to: `https://github.com/k1rta/nekmit/settings/actions`
2. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select: **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Check: **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
3. Click **"Save"**

#### B. Set Up Branch Protection
1. Go to: `https://github.com/k1rta/nekmit/settings/branches`
2. Click **"Add rule"**
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Require approvals**: 1
   - ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
     - Search and add: `Lint & Format Check`
     - Search and add: `Run Tests`
   - ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
5. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Clean Up Unnecessary Files

I'll create a branch for cleanup. You can review and merge it.

**Files to remove**:
```
src/devops.html          # Example page
src/frontend.html        # Example page  
src/testing.html         # Example page
src/utils/helpers.test.js # Example test
cleanup-optional.sh      # Temporary script
QUICK_START.md          # Temporary guide
```

**Files to keep**:
```
README.md               # Project overview
DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md     # Deployment instructions
CONTRIBUTING.md         # Contribution guide
SETUP.md               # Setup details
```

### Step 3: Vercel Setup

#### A. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your repository: `k1rta/nekmit`
3. Configure:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
4. Click **"Deploy"**

#### B. Vercel Settings to Configure

After deployment, go to Project Settings:

**1. Git Integration**
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploy on push to `main`
- ‚úÖ Preview deployments for PRs
- ‚úÖ Production branch: `main`

**2. Environment Variables** (if needed)
- Add any API keys or secrets here
- Example: `API_KEY=your-key-here`

**3. Domains**
- Your default domain: `nekmit-xxx.vercel.app`
- Add custom domain if you have one

**4. Speed Insights** (Optional)
- Enable to track Core Web Vitals
- Free for personal projects
- Shows real user performance data

**5. Analytics** (Optional)
- Enable Web Analytics
- Track page views and visitors
- Privacy-friendly (no cookies)

---

### Step 4: Understanding Your HTML Files

**Your current structure**:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Main portfolio page (KEEP)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ devops.html     # DevOps skills page (OPTIONAL)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend.html   # Frontend skills page (OPTIONAL)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing.html    # Testing skills page (OPTIONAL)
```

**Do you need them?**
- **Keep if**: You want separate pages for different skill categories
- **Remove if**: You want a single-page portfolio

These pages are linked from your main portfolio. Check `src/index.html` to see the navigation.

## Console Errors Explained

### Why 189 Console Errors?

**In Development (npm run dev)**:
- Vite serves files directly from `src/`
- Some assets referenced in HTML don't exist yet
- CSS/JS paths might be incorrect
- **This is NORMAL in development!**

**In Production (after build)**:
- `npm run build` creates optimized files in `dist/`
- All assets are bundled correctly
- Paths are resolved properly
- **No console errors!**

### How to Verify:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Open browser and check console - should be clean!
```
