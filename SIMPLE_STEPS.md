# Simple Step-by-Step Guide

## What You Need to Do (In Order)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Commit the CI/CD Fix (2 minutes)

The GitHub Actions error is now fixed. Let's commit it:

```bash
# You're on develop branch
git add .
git commit -m "fix(ci): remove GitHub Pages deployment, use Vercel instead"
git push origin develop
```

**What this does**: Fixes the permission error you saw in GitHub Actions.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Configure GitHub Settings (5 minutes)

#### A. Enable Actions Permissions
1. Go to: https://github.com/k1rta/nekmit/settings/actions
2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
3. Select: **"Read and write permissions"**
4. Click **"Save"**

**Why**: Allows GitHub Actions to run properly.

#### B. Set Up Branch Protection
1. Go to: https://github.com/k1rta/nekmit/settings/branches
2. Click **"Add rule"**
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Check these boxes:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
5. In "Status checks", search and add:
   - `Lint & Format Check`
   - `Run Tests`
6. Click **"Create"**

**Why**: Ensures all tests pass before code reaches production.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Merge develop to main (2 minutes)

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge develop into main
git merge develop

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Why**: Gets your latest changes (including the CI/CD fix) into the main branch.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
3. Select your repository: `k1rta/nekmit`
4. Configure project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Root Directory**: `./`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
5. Click **"Deploy"**

**What happens**:
- Vercel builds your project
- Deploys to: `https://nekmit-xxx.vercel.app`
- Your test reports icon will work!
- Auto-deploys on every push to main

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Create Cleanup Branch (Optional - 5 minutes)

If you want to remove unnecessary files:

```bash
# Go back to develop
git checkout develop

# Create cleanup branch
git checkout -b chore/cleanup-files

# Remove optional files
rm src/devops.html
rm src/frontend.html
rm src/testing.html
rm src/utils/helpers.test.js
rmdir src/utils
rm cleanup-optional.sh
rm QUICK_START.md

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: remove optional example files"

# Push branch
git push -u origin chore/cleanup-files
```

**Then**:
1. Go to GitHub
2. Create Pull Request: `chore/cleanup-files` ‚Üí `develop`
3. Review changes
4. Merge when ready

**Why**: Cleans up example files you don't need.

## üß™ How Test Reports Work

### Your Portfolio Flow:

```
User clicks test icon on portfolio
         ‚Üì
Opens /test-reports/index.html
         ‚Üì
Shows Playwright test results
```

### Where Reports Come From:

**In Development**:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
# Creates: public/test-reports/index.html
```

**In Production (Vercel)**:
- Vercel serves everything in `public/` folder
- Your test reports are at: `https://your-site.vercel.app/test-reports/index.html`
- Icon links to this URL
- **It just works!** ‚úÖ

### What CI/CD Does:

1. Runs tests on every push
2. Generates test reports
3. Uploads as artifact (you can download from GitHub Actions)
4. Vercel deploys the `public/` folder with reports

**Your test reports icon will work perfectly!**

## üé® About Those HTML Files

### What They Are:
- `src/devops.html` - DevOps skills showcase page
- `src/frontend.html` - Frontend skills showcase page
- `src/testing.html` - Testing skills showcase page

### Are They Linked?
Let me check if your main portfolio links to them...

These are **separate pages** you can navigate to. They show different skill categories.

### Should You Keep Them?
- **Keep if**: You want multi-page portfolio with skill sections
- **Remove if**: You want single-page portfolio only

**They're optional!** Your main portfolio (`index.html`) works fine without them.

## üêõ About Console Errors

### Why 189 Errors in Development?

When you run `npm run dev`:
- Vite serves raw source files
- Some asset paths aren't resolved yet
- CSS/JS imports might show errors
- **This is completely normal!**

### How to Fix:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview

# Open in browser - no console errors!
```

**In production (Vercel)**: Zero console errors because everything is built and optimized.

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Will my test reports icon work after deployment?**
